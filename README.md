# OpenHS

OpenHS is a simulator core for the game Hearthstone, implemented in Go. This project aims to provide a robust and efficient implementation of Hearthstone's core game mechanics.

## Implemented Features

- **Game Engine Framework**:
  - Core game loop with phase management (BeginFirst, BeginShuffle, BeginDraw, etc.)
  - Turn-based gameplay flow with player switching

- **Card System**: 
  - Card template loading from JSON configurations
  - Basic card types (Minion, Spell, Weapon, Hero, HeroPower)
  - Card effect framework with triggers and conditions
  - Card tags implementation (Poisonous, Rush, Windfury, etc.)

- **Player Management**:
  - Player state tracking including hero, deck, hand, and board
  
- **Game Mechanics**:
  - Initial game setup with card drawing
  - Turn management with phase transitions
  - Card drawing mechanism with fatigue damage
  - Playing cards from hand to the field
  - Full combat system with minion/hero attacks
  - Mana crystal management
  - Death processing and graveyard management

- **Web Frontend**:
  - Text-based visual representation of the game
  - Interactive game board with player and opponent areas
  - Ability to play cards, attack with minions, and end turns
  - Clean CSS-based card designs with simple icons
  - Game log for tracking actions

## TODO List

- **Game Mechanics**:
  - Complete mulligan phase implementation
  - Hero powers implementation
  - More tags implementation (See `docs/tags.md`)
  - More advanced card effects and interactions
  - Secrets and auras implementation

- **Card Library**:
  - Implement more cards from the basic and classic sets
  - Add card rarity and classes

- **Game Features**:
  - Game history and replay system
  - Game state serialization/deserialization
  - Network play support
  - AI opponents
